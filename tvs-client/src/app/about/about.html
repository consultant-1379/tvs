        The <strong>Ericsson Test Management System</strong> provides unified management
        of automatic and manual test cases and is integrated with existing Ericsson technology,
        such as Eiffel and Test Environment Orchestration Framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        Heavy emphasis is placed on dynamic selection of test cases –
        the ability to automatically and in real time select and execute the tests
        that provide the greatest value at any given time,
        according a pre-defined set of criteria –
        which enable more efficient use of time and test resources.
        It also stresses the need to align automated and manual testing in the same system,
        and automated support for fact based release decisions.
